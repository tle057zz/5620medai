- ‚úÖ Multiple subsidy types (Medicare, Health Care Card, Pensioner, Student, Family)
- ‚úÖ Affordability scoring (0-100 scale)
- ‚úÖ Additional assistance options (payment plans, loans, charity)
- ‚úÖ Integration with insurance quotes
- ‚è≥ UI templates (pending)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components Created

#### 1. **financial_assistance.py** ‚úÖ (450+ lines)
Complete backend logic for subsidy calculation and financial assistance.

**Data Models**:
```python
- SubsidyType (Enum): ACA_PREMIUM, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, STATE_PROGRAM
- EligibilityStatus (Enum): ELIGIBLE, PARTIALLY_ELIGIBLE, NOT_ELIGIBLE
- FinancialProfile (dataclass): User's financial data (income, household, cards)
- SubsidyCalculation (dataclass): Individual subsidy with amount and rationale
- AffordabilityScore (dataclass): 0-100 score with rating and concerns
- FinancialAssistanceOption (dataclass): Loan/payment plan details
- AssistanceRecommendation (dataclass): Complete recommendation package
```

**Key Functions**:
- ‚úÖ `calculate_subsidies()` - Calculates all applicable subsidies
- ‚úÖ `calculate_affordability_score()` - Scores plan affordability (0-100)
- ‚úÖ `generate_assistance_options()` - Creates payment plans/loans/charity options
- ‚úÖ `create_assistance_recommendation()` - Generates complete recommendation
- ‚úÖ `get_assistance_recommendation()` - Retrieves by ID

**Subsidy Types Implemented** (Australian Healthcare Context):
1. **Medicare Card Holder**: 15% premium reduction
2. **Health Care Card**: 25% premium reduction
3. **Pensioner/Senior**: 30% premium reduction
4. **Student Discount**: 20% premium reduction
5. **Family/Household Size**: 10% per additional member (capped at 30%)

**Affordability Scoring**:
- **95+ (Excellent)**: ‚â§5% of income
- **80+ (Good)**: 5-8% of income
- **60+ (Fair)**: 8-12% of income
- **40+ (Borderline)**: 12-15% of income
- **<40 (Poor)**: >15% of income

#### 2. **Flask Routes (app.py)** ‚úÖ (3 new routes)

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/financial-assistance/<request_id>` | GET | Entry from insurance quote |
| `/financial-assistance/request` | GET, POST | Assistance request form |
| `/financial-assistance/recommendation/<id>` | GET | View results |
| `/financial-assistance/export/<id>` | GET | Export as JSON |

**Security**:
- All routes require `@login_required`
- Restricted to `@role_required('patient')`
- User verification on all data access

## üí∞ Subsidy Calculation Logic

### Australian Healthcare System Subsidies

#### 1. Medicare Card Benefits
```python
if has_medicare_card or annual_income < $90,000:
    subsidy = 15% of monthly premium
    requirements = ["Valid Medicare card", "Income verification"]
```

#### 2. Health Care Card
```python
if has_health_care_card or annual_income < $60,000:
    subsidy = 25% of monthly premium
    requirements = ["Valid Health Care Card"]
```

#### 3. Pensioner Discount
```python
if pensioner:
    subsidy = 30% of monthly premium
    requirements = ["Pensioner Concession Card", "Age verification"]
```

#### 4. Student Discount
```python
if student and annual_income < $40,000:
    subsidy = 20% of monthly premium
    requirements = ["Valid student ID", "Enrollment verification"]
```

#### 5. Family Size Adjustment
```python
if household_size >= 3:
    subsidy_per_member = 10% * (household_size - 2)
    subsidy = min(subsidy_per_member, 30%)  # capped
    requirements = ["Household composition verification"]
```

### Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Calculation
```python
baseline_income = $92,000  # Australian median household income
adjusted_baseline = baseline + (household_size - 1) * $15,000
fpl_percentage = (annual_income / adjusted_baseline) * 100
```

## üí° Design Decisions

### 1. **Australian Healthcare Focus**
Decision: Use Australian Medicare/Health Care Card system  
Rationale: Project context (ELEC5620 at USYD), realistic for target audience  
Alternative: US ACA system could be swapped in easily

### 2. **Multiple Stacking Subsidies**
Decision: Allow all eligible subsidies to stack  
Rationale: Maximize affordability for low-income users  
Limitation: In production, may need caps/limits

### 3. **Affordability Threshold: 15% of Income**
Decision: Plans >15% of income flagged as unaffordable  
Rationale: Industry standard for healthcare affordability  
Source: WHO and healthcare policy research

### 4. **Auto-Generated Assistance Options**
Decision: Automatically suggest loans/payment plans when unaffordable  
Rationale: Proactive UX, reduces user frustration  
Risk: May appear pushy - needs careful messaging
