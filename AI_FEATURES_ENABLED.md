## 🎯 AI Medical Pipeline Flow

When you upload a document, this happens:

```
1. UPLOAD
   📄 PDF or TXT file
   ↓
2. OCR EXTRACTION
   📝 Extract raw text
   ↓
3. SECTIONIZATION
   📋 Split into sections (History, Medications, Labs, etc.)
   ↓
4. NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
   🔍 Identify medical entities
   - DISEASE: "Type 2 Diabetes"
   - MEDICATION: "Metformin 500mg"
   - OBSERVATION: "BMI: 28.5"
   ↓
5. ENTITY LINKING
   🔗 Link to medical ontologies
   - SNOMED-CT codes
   - RxNorm codes
   - LOINC codes
   ↓
6. AUTO-FILL FORM
   ✨ Populate insurance quote form
   ↓
7. RISK ASSESSMENT
   🎯 Calculate insurance risk score
   ↓
8. QUOTE GENERATION
   💰 Generate tailored insurance quotes
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Document Upload Doesn't Work:

1. **Check file format:**
   - Only PDF and TXT are supported
   - File must contain readable text (not scanned images for TXT)

2. **Check server logs:**
   - Look for error messages in terminal
   - Common issue: No entities found (file too short)

3. **Try different documents:**
   - Use the provided sample files first
   - Ensure documents contain medical terminology

### If Server Won't Start:

1. **Port already in use:**
   ```bash
   killall python3.11
   ```

2. **Wrong environment:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're using venv_ai
   which python3.11
   # Should show: .../venv_ai/bin/python3.11
   ```

3. **Missing packages:**
   ```bash
   pip list | grep -E "spacy|scispacy|flask"
   ```
