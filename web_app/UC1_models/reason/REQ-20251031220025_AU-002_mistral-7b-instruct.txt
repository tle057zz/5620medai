This PPO plan from Medibank Private offers comprehensive coverage for your health conditions, including hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. With a $750,000 coverage limit, it provides substantial financial support for managing your medical needs. Despite the higher monthly premium of $420, the plan's maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6000 helps maintain affordability for your upper-middle income bracket, especially considering your high risk level (100). This plan is a suitable choice due to its comprehensive coverage and manageable costs that cater to your health requirements.
