The plan offers hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drug coverage, and preventive care, all of which are critical components for managing the user's chronic conditions effectively.

Moreover, with a high deductible of $2500, the user will be responsible for covering initial healthcare expenses up to this amount before the insurance kicks in.
