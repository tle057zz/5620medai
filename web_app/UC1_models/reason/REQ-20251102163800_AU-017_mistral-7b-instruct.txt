Given the user's medical history of hypertension, a comprehensive health insurance plan is essential to manage ongoing healthcare needs effectively and affordably. The EPO plan from Health Care Insurance (HCI) appears to be an excellent fit for this profile.

Firstly, the plan offers substantial coverage with a policy limit of $500,000, which should provide ample financial protection in case of hospitalization due to hypertension or any other health complications that may arise. The user's risk score of 72 indicates a slightly elevated risk profile, making the extensive coverage particularly beneficial.

Secondly, the monthly premium of $300 is manageable given the user's middle income bracket. While it is essential to consider other financial commitments and expenses, this plan's balance between coverage and affordability makes it a suitable option for the user.

Thirdly, the EPO plan from HCI covers not only hospitalization but also outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, ensuring comprehensive coverage for the user's ongoing healthcare needs related to hypertension management. However, it is essential to note that the plan does exclude cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, which may not be relevant for the user's medical history and current condition.

In summary, the EPO plan from HCI offers suitable coverage, affordability, and comprehensive services tailored to the user's hypertension diagnosis, income bracket, and risk profile. The policy's hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care align with the user's medical needs, while its monthly premium remains manageable within their financial means.
