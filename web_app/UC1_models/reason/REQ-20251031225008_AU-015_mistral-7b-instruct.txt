Given your comprehensive medical history that includes hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, shortness of breath, fatigue, and right-sided weakness, this PPO plan from AIA Health Insurance seems well-suited to address your health needs. The coverage of $750,000 ensures substantial financial protection for managing your medical conditions.

The monthly premium of $420 is affordable within the upper-middle income bracket, providing you with access to hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. This plan's comprehensive coverage can help you manage your chronic conditions effectively while keeping costs reasonable.

Additionally, the plan has a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6000, which may further assist in managing your healthcare expenses during the year. Although the plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, these are unlikely to be essential for managing your current medical conditions. This plan offers a balance between coverage and affordability tailored to your health profile.
