Given the user's medical history that includes Hypertension, a comprehensive health insurance plan is crucial to manage ongoing medical care effectively. The EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plan from National Health Benefits Australia (OneMedifund) appears to be a suitable option for this user profile.

Firstly, the monthly premium of $300 aligns well with the user's upper-middle income bracket, making it affordable and accessible. The high coverage of $500,000 offers substantial financial protection in case of extensive medical treatments that may be required due to Hypertension complications.

Secondly, the plan's inclusions of hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care cater to the user's need for ongoing medical management. Regular hospital visits, medication requirements, and preventive health check-ups are crucial aspects that this plan covers, ensuring comprehensive healthcare support.

Lastly, the $2500 deductible and $6500 Max Out-of-Pocket (Max OOP) limits help protect the user from excessive financial burden in case of medical emergencies. Although these figures might still require some out-of-pocket expenses, they are reasonable considering the extensive coverage provided by this plan.

Overall, the EPO plan from OneMedifund offers a balance between affordability and comprehensive coverage that addresses the user's specific health condition and income level. Exclusions such as cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments can help manage costs while ensuring essential medical needs are met.
