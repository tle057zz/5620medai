Given your health profile, which includes conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke, a comprehensive insurance plan like EPO from Reserve Bank Health Society could be beneficial. This plan offers hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drug benefits, and maternity care â€“ all of which are crucial for managing your health conditions.

Moreover, with coverage up to $750,000, it provides extensive financial protection for potential high medical costs associated with your health issues. The monthly premium of $320 is affordable given your middle-income bracket, and the deductible of $1800 and Max Out-of-Pocket limit of $5000 ensure that you won't face excessive financial burden when utilizing the plan's benefits. However, it's important to note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are excluded from this policy. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your insurance needs.
