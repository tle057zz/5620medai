Given the user's medical history of hypertension and current data indicating no complications, the EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plan from National Health Benefits Australia (OneMedifund) is a suitable choice that balances coverage and affordability.

Firstly, this plan offers comprehensive hospitalization coverage, which is crucial for managing any potential hypertension-related complications. With a policy limit of $500,000, the user will have significant financial protection in case of severe health events requiring hospitalization.

Secondly, the plan includes outpatient services and prescription drug coverage. These benefits are essential for ongoing management of hypertension, which often requires regular medication and check-ups. The monthly premium of $300 is affordable considering the user's middle income bracket, ensuring manageable healthcare expenses.

Lastly, the deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense of $6500 provide additional cost protection for the user. This means that once these amounts are met, the insurance will cover the remaining costs for covered services within the policy limits, making it easier for the user to manage healthcare expenses throughout the year.

In summary, the EPO plan from OneMedifund offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, and prescription drugs - all crucial for managing hypertension effectively. Its affordability, combined with cost protection features like the deductible and maximum OOP expense, make it a suitable choice for this user's medical needs and income bracket. However, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or insurance advisor for personalized advice based on individual circumstances.
