For the user with a medical history of hypertension, the EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plan from National Health Benefits Australia's oneMedifund is well-suited to their needs due to its comprehensive coverage, affordability, and risk-based premium structure.

Firstly, this plan offers hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drug benefits, and preventive care which are essential for managing hypertension effectively. The $500,000 coverage ensures that the user will be well-protected in case of any extensive medical procedures related to their condition, while the outpatient services and prescription drug benefits help with regular check-ups and medication needs.

Secondly, the affordability of this plan aligns well with the user's upper-middle income bracket. The monthly premium of $300 is manageable for most individuals in this income range. Additionally, the risk factor of 72.0 suggests that the user has a moderate health risk profile, which is reflected in the competitive pricing of this plan.

Lastly, this plan's Max Out-of-Pocket (Max OOP) limit of $6500 is beneficial for the user as it provides a cap on their yearly expenses for healthcare services. This limit can help manage costs and ensure financial stability throughout the year. In conclusion, the EPO from National Health Benefits Australia's oneMedifund offers suitable coverage for the user's medical needs while being affordable given their income bracket and risk profile.
