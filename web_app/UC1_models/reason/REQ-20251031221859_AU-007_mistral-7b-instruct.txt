The EPO plan from Australian Unity Health fits your profile due to its comprehensive coverage for conditions you're dealing with, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke. With a hospitalization coverage of $500,000, it provides substantial financial protection in case of hospital visits related to these conditions. Additionally, the plan covers outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care â€“ all essential components for managing your health conditions effectively.

Furthermore, this plan offers a middle-income-friendly monthly premium of $300, making it more affordable for you while still providing extensive coverage. The deductible of $2500 ensures that you only pay this amount towards your healthcare expenses before the insurance starts covering costs, which is lower than the maximum out-of-pocket limit of $6500. This means you will have less financial burden in case of significant medical expenses. However, it's important to note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are not covered under this plan. Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on your insurance needs.
