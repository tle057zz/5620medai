Given your low income bracket and high-risk status (72.0) due to hypertension, the Defence Health EPO plan offers an affordable monthly premium of $320 with a comprehensive coverage of $750,000, providing substantial financial protection for potential health issues related to hypertension or other conditions. Furthermore, this plan includes essential benefits such as hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and maternity care which cater to your health needs. While the deductible is set at $1800 and there's a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $5000, these amounts may be manageable for someone in your income bracket, making this plan a suitable choice that balances coverage and affordability for you.
