Given the user's medical history of hypertension, it is crucial to have comprehensive coverage for hospitalization in case of any emergencies or complications related to their condition. The HMO plan from ahm (by Medibank) offers hospitalization coverage with a substantial sum insured of $250,000, which should provide sufficient protection in the event of a hospital stay.

In terms of affordability, the user's upper-middle income bracket allows them to comfortably afford the monthly premium of $260. This plan also has a reasonable deductible of $3500, meaning that after this amount is met, the insurance will start covering the costs. However, it's important to note that the user may still be responsible for up to $7500 in out-of-pocket expenses each year, which could be a consideration when managing overall healthcare costs.

Furthermore, this plan includes coverage for outpatient services and prescription drugs, both of which are likely to be important factors for someone managing hypertension. Additionally, the inclusion of telemedicine services in this plan may provide convenience and cost savings by allowing consultations with doctors remotely.

Overall, the HMO plan from ahm appears to offer appropriate coverage for the user's medical history and current needs, while also being affordable given their income level. However, it is always advisable to carefully review the details of any insurance policy and consider other factors such as network providers and exclusions before making a final decision.
