Given the user's medical history of hypertension, it is crucial to have comprehensive health insurance coverage that includes hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. The EPO plan from Westfund Health Insurance meets these requirements with a monthly premium of $300.

The plan offers a substantial coverage of $500,000, providing ample financial protection in case of unforeseen medical emergencies related to the user's hypertension or any other health issues that may arise. The deductible of $2500 means the user will only be responsible for this amount before the insurance starts covering costs, which is manageable within the context of their middle income bracket.

Moreover, the user's risk score of 72 indicates a moderate health risk, making it essential to have a plan with a reasonable balance between coverage and affordability. This EPO plan strikes that balance effectively by offering extensive coverage while keeping the premium affordable for the user's income level. The plan also limits out-of-pocket expenses to $6500, providing additional financial security for unexpected medical costs.

In summary, the EPO plan from Westfund Health Insurance is an appropriate fit for this user profile due to its comprehensive coverage of necessary health services, manageable premium and deductible within the user's income bracket, and reasonable out-of-pocket expense limit, which are all crucial factors in addressing the user's medical history and risk level. However, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or insurance advisor for personalized advice based on specific health needs and circumstances.
