Given your extensive medical history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, shortness of breath, fatigue, right-sided weakness, and considering you fall within the middle income bracket, the EPO plan from National Health Benefits Australia (onemedifund) seems suitable for your needs.

This plan offers comprehensive coverage with a focus on hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, all of which are crucial for managing your health conditions effectively. The $500,000 coverage provides substantial financial protection should you require intensive medical treatment due to your multiple chronic illnesses.

The plan's affordability is also advantageous, with a monthly premium of $300 and a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500, making it less burdensome for middle-income individuals like yourself. While the plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, these are unlikely to be necessary given your current medical situation. This plan's balance between coverage and affordability aligns well with your medical history, income bracket, and risk level. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your specific health needs and insurance options.
