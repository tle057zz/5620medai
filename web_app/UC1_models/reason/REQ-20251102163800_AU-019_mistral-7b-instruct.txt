Firstly, considering the user's medical history that includes hypertension, a chronic condition that requires ongoing management, the comprehensive coverage of hospitalization offered by this plan is particularly beneficial. With a maximum coverage of $500,000, the plan provides ample financial support for potential hospital stays related to hypertension or any other health issues that may arise in the future.

Thirdly, the plan offers coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. These benefits are essential for managing chronic conditions like hypertension, ensuring regular medication refills, and promoting overall health through preventive care.

Lastly, the deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 are reasonable limits that can help the user manage their healthcare costs, especially considering the coverage for essential services.
