Given the user's medical history that includes hypertension, a middle-income bracket, and a moderate risk score of 72.0, the EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plan from HIF (Healthcare Insurance Foundation) appears to be a suitable fit for this individual's needs.

Firstly, the user's medical history necessitates comprehensive hospitalization coverage in case of any severe complications related to hypertension. The EPO plan offers substantial coverage with a maximum payout of $500,000, ensuring that critical care expenses can be adequately managed.

Secondly, considering the user's current medical data, ongoing management of hypertension often requires outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care to maintain optimal health. The EPO plan includes coverage for these services, making it easier for the user to manage their condition effectively while minimizing out-of-pocket expenses with a reasonable deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $6500 per year.

Lastly, the affordability of the plan aligns well with the user's middle-income bracket, as the monthly premium is set at $300. It's essential to note that while this plan offers extensive coverage, it excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, which may not be a primary concern for this user given their medical history.

In summary, the EPO plan from HIF provides ample hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care to accommodate the user's needs arising from their hypertension condition, while also being affordable within their income bracket. The exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments further supports the suitability of this plan for this user profile.
