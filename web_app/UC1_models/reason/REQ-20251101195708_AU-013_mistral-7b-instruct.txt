Based on the user's medical history, which includes hypertension, a comprehensive health insurance plan is essential to manage ongoing medical expenses associated with this condition. The EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization) plan from Westfund Health Insurance offers suitable coverage for this profile.

Firstly, the $500,000 coverage provides substantial financial protection in case of severe medical emergencies or hospitalization due to hypertension-related complications. With a deductible of $2500, the user will be required to cover the first $2500 of eligible healthcare expenses annually before the insurance kicks in, which is affordable for an upper-middle income individual with a monthly premium of $300.

Additionally, this plan's key benefits include coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, all of which are crucial components to manage hypertension effectively. The plan does exclude cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, ensuring the user is not responsible for costs associated with non-essential medical treatments.

Given the user's income bracket and risk level of 72.0, this EPO plan from Westfund Health Insurance offers a balanced combination of coverage and affordability that caters specifically to the user's needs and financial circumstances. Regular check-ups, medication management, and potential hospitalization due to hypertension complications will be well-covered under this plan, providing peace of mind for the user as they manage their health.
