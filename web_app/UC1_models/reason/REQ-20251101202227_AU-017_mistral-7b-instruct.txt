Based on the user's medical history and current data, it is evident that they have been diagnosed with hypertension, a long-term medical condition that requires regular monitoring and management. Given their upper-middle income bracket, they are likely to afford comprehensive health coverage that can cater to both immediate and ongoing healthcare needs.

The EPO plan from Health Care Insurance (HCI) seems to be an ideal fit for the user's profile. With a monthly premium of $300, this plan offers substantial coverage of $500,000, which should provide ample financial protection in case of unexpected medical emergencies or hospitalizations related to hypertension. The deductible of $2500 ensures that the user will not bear excessive costs for out-of-pocket expenses before the insurance coverage kicks in.

Moreover, this plan includes coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, all of which are essential aspects of hypertension management. By regularly visiting healthcare providers for check-ups and medication refills, the user can ensure optimal control of their blood pressure levels to reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease or stroke.

While the plan does exclude coverage for cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, it is essential to note that these services are unlikely to be required by someone managing a chronic condition like hypertension. The key focus for this user should be on securing comprehensive yet affordable coverage that addresses their primary healthcare needs, which the EPO plan from HCI successfully achieves.
