Given your extensive medical history, which includes hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, shortness of breath, fatigue, ischemic stroke, right-sided weakness, and a risk level of 100, the Australian Unity Health EPO plan with a monthly premium of $300 appears to align well with your needs.

This plan offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all crucial components for managing your health conditions effectively. The high coverage limit of $500,000 provides substantial financial protection in case of significant medical events.

Moreover, considering your middle income bracket, the affordability of this plan is reasonable compared to other plans with similar benefits. However, it's essential to note that the plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments - an exclusion that may help manage costs while focusing on necessary healthcare services for your medical history.
