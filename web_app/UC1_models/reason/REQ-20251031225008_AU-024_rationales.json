With a monthly premium of $320, it is affordable considering your upper-middle income bracket.\n\nMoreover, the plan offers up to $750,000 in coverage and has a reasonable annual deductible of $1800, which can help manage out-of-pocket expenses for your ongoing medical needs related to diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. The plan's maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) limit of $5000 ensures that you are protected from excessive healthcare costs during a given year.\n\nThe exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments further reinforces the cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of this plan for your medical history and current health data, as it avoids unnecessary expenses on non-essential treatments while focusing on addressing your primary conditions."
