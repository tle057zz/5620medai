Moreover, the plan has a deductible of $2000 and a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $6000, which can provide some cost certainty for the user in case of health care expenses.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that while cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are excluded from coverage under this plan, the primary focus seems to be on addressing the user's significant medical needs, making it a more practical choice given their health profile."
