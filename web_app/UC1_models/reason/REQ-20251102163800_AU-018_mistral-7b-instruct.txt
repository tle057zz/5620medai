Given the user's medical history of hypertension, a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers hospitalization and outpatient services is crucial to manage ongoing health care needs effectively. The EPO plan from Queensland Country Health offers $500,000 in coverage, which provides ample financial support for potential hospital stays or specialized treatments related to hypertension. The monthly premium of $300 is within the user's middle income bracket, ensuring affordability without causing undue financial strain.

Furthermore, the plan's inclusion of prescription drug coverage will help in managing the user's medications for hypertension, which are essential to control blood pressure and prevent complications. The preventive care benefits within this policy are also valuable as they encourage regular check-ups and screenings, enabling early detection and management of any potential health issues arising from hypertension or other comorbidities.

Lastly, the user's risk score of 72 indicates a moderately high health risk profile. This plan balances coverage needs with affordability by incorporating a deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500. While these cost-sharing measures may require the user to pay some expenses upfront, they help keep premiums more affordable for the user's income level while providing substantial coverage for potential health care costs.

In summary, the EPO plan from Queensland Country Health is a suitable choice for this user due to its comprehensive coverage of hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care; affordability within the user's income bracket; and appropriate cost-sharing measures that balance coverage needs with financial considerations given the user's moderate health risk profile.
