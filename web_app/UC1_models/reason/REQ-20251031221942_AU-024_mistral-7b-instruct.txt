This EPO plan from Navy Health, with a monthly premium of $320, aligns well with your health profile due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization related to your conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke), outpatient services, maternity care, and prescription drugs. The high-value coverage of up to $750,000 provides significant financial protection, considering potential medical expenses associated with your health issues.

Additionally, the deductible of $1800 and max out-of-pocket expense of $5000 make this plan more affordable for individuals in a high-income bracket like yours, ensuring you have access to essential healthcare services without undue financial burden. Given your elevated risk level (100), this plan offers an optimal balance between coverage and affordability for your medical needs.
