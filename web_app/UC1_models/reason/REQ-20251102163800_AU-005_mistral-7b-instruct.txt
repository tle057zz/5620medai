Given the user's medical history of hypertension, a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan from nib Health Funds could be an appropriate fit due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization and outpatient services, which are crucial for managing hypertension effectively. With a monthly premium of $420, this plan offers a balance between coverage and affordability, making it suitable for the user's middle income bracket.

Moreover, the plan provides coverage up to $750,000, which is substantial for addressing potential complications associated with hypertension, such as heart disease or stroke. The deductible of $2000 and maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense of $6000 help limit the user's financial exposure in case of extensive medical treatment.

In addition, this plan includes coverage for prescription drugs and preventive care, both essential components for managing hypertension over the long term. While the plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, these exclusions are common among insurance plans to help manage costs. Overall, the PPO plan from nib Health Funds appears well-suited to address the user's medical needs while offering an affordable level of coverage given their income bracket and risk score (72.0). It is essential for the user to consult with a healthcare professional or insurance advisor for personalized recommendations and guidance regarding this plan.
