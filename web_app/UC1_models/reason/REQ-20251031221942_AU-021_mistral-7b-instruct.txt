The Defence Health EPO plan caters well to your health profile given your high-risk status due to multiple chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. With a comprehensive coverage of $750,000, this plan provides substantial financial support for hospitalization costs, which are essential considering the nature of your medical issues.

Additionally, the plan includes outpatient services, prescription drugs, and maternity care, addressing your potential need for regular check-ups, medication, and future family planning. The monthly premium of $320 is affordable compared to other plans given your high income bracket, while maintaining a reasonable deductible of $1800 and Max Out Of Pocket limit of $5000 to help manage your overall healthcare expenses.

However, it's important to note that the plan does exclude cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, ensuring that you are covered for essential medical needs while avoiding unnecessary costs associated with non-essential services.
