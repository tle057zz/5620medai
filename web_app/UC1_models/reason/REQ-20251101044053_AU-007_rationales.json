The Australian Unity Health's EPO plan with a monthly premium of $300 offers just that, providing $500,000 in coverage, which should be sufficient to cover the potential expenses associated with the user's medical conditions.\n\nThe plan also includes a deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense of $6500, which could help manage costs for the user in case of unexpected medical emergencies or hospital stays. As the user falls within the middle income bracket and has a high risk score of 100, this plan offers an affordable option for the required coverage.\n\nFurthermore, the EPO plan from Australian Unity Health excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, ensuring that the user will not face unexpected costs for non-essential services. Overall, this plan fits the user's profile by providing the necessary coverage for their medical conditions, offering an affordable monthly premium within their income bracket, and eliminating potential expenses for non-essential services."
