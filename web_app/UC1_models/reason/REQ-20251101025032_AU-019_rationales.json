The EPO plan from Mildura Health Fund offers substantial coverage that aligns with the user's needs. With a monthly premium of $300, this plan falls within the middle income bracket, making it relatively affordable for the user.\n\nThe plan's $500,000 coverage for hospitalization ensures comprehensive care in case of emergencies or hospital stays related to hypertension management. Furthermore, the outpatient services and prescription drug coverage will cater to routine check-ups and medication requirements that are essential for managing hypertension. Preventive care within this plan will also encourage regular screenings and check-ups, which are vital for maintaining optimal health and addressing potential issues early.\n\nGiven the user's risk score of 72.0, indicating a moderate risk profile, this plan offers a suitable balance between coverage and cost. The deductible of $2500 and Max Out-of-Pocket (Max OOP) limit of $6500 help manage costs for the user by requiring them to pay for some healthcare expenses upfront before the insurance kicks in. However, these limits are reasonable considering the comprehensive coverage provided by the plan.\n\nIn summary, the EPO plan from Mildura Health Fund fits the user's profile well due to its affordable premium, comprehensive coverage, and inclusion of essential benefits such as hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. The plan's deductible and Max Out-of-Pocket limits also provide a manageable balance for the user's moderate risk level."
