Given your medical history with multiple conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke, the EPO plan from Australian Unity Health could be a suitable option due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. This plan provides $500,000 worth of coverage, which can help manage high medical costs associated with your conditions.

Additionally, this plan has a monthly premium of $300, making it affordable within your high-income bracket. Although there is a deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 per year, these limits can help protect you from excessive medical bills while ensuring the plan remains financially manageable for you. This plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, which may help minimize potential unexpected expenses.
