The EPO plan from Transport Health / Union Health seems well-suited for your health profile given the prevalence of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke. This plan offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and maternity care â€“ all crucial aspects considering your multiple health concerns. The monthly premium of $320 is affordable within the middle-income bracket, and the coverage of $750,000 provides significant financial protection should extensive medical treatments be required. Additionally, with a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $5000, you are protected against high unexpected costs. Although the plan has a deductible of $1800, it remains lower compared to other plans given your higher risk level (100). However, it's essential to remember that this plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments. Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your needs.
