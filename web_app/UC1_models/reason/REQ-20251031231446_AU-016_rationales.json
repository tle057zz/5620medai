The MyOwn Health Insurance HMO plan provides such coverage, with a monthly premium of $340, which fits within the middle income bracket.\n\nMoreover, this plan offers substantial coverage of up to $500,000, which should be sufficient for addressing your significant medical conditions. Additionally, considering your elevated risk level (100), having a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 can help provide financial protection during potential health emergencies or ongoing treatment needs. The plan's exclusions for cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments align with focusing on essential medical care, making it an appropriate fit for your current medical situation."
