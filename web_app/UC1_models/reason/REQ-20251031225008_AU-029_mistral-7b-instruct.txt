Given your medical history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, right-sided weakness, and shortness of breath, it's crucial to have comprehensive coverage for both inpatient and outpatient services, prescription drugs, and maternity care, as these conditions often require regular medical attention. The EPO plan from RT Health Fund offers coverage up to $750,000 which should provide significant protection in case of major health events related to your conditions.

The monthly premium of $320 is manageable for an upper-middle income bracket individual, while the deductible of $1800 and Max Out-of-Pocket limit of $5000 help control potential additional costs. This plan's exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments may also be beneficial as it helps focus resources on necessary medical care.

Overall, this EPO plan from RT Health Fund offers a suitable balance between coverage for your specific medical needs and affordability considering your income level. However, always consult with your healthcare provider to ensure the plan aligns with your personal health requirements.
