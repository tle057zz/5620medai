Given the user's medical history of hypertension, a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care is essential to manage their ongoing condition effectively. The EPO (Exclusive Provider Network) plan from Australian Unity Health is an appropriate choice due to its extensive coverage in line with the user's needs.

This plan offers a high coverage amount of $500,000, providing substantial financial protection for potential hospitalization related to hypertension or other health issues that may arise in the future. The monthly premium of $300 is within the user's upper-middle income bracket, making it an affordable option while maintaining sufficient coverage.

Furthermore, the plan's deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket expense (MOOP) of $6500 help to mitigate financial risk for the user by capping their expenses in case of unexpected medical events. However, it is important to note that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, which may be relevant considerations depending on the user's personal medical history and anticipated healthcare needs.

In summary, the EPO plan from Australian Unity Health fits the user's profile well due to its comprehensive coverage for essential health services, affordability within their income bracket, and risk-mitigating features such as a deductible and MOOP. The plan's exclusions of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments should also be taken into account when evaluating the plan's overall suitability for the user.
