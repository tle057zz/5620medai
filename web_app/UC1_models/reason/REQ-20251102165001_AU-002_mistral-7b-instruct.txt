Given the user's upper-middle income bracket and a moderate health risk score of 40.0, the PPO plan from Medibank Private appears to be a suitable choice due to its balanced coverage and affordability.

Firstly, this plan offers comprehensive hospitalization coverage with a high policy limit of $750,000, which may cater well to potential hospitalizations or serious medical events that could arise in the future, considering no specific health conditions are currently stated in the user's profile.

Secondly, the monthly premium of $420 fits within the budget of an upper-middle income earner and is competitive compared to other plans offering similar benefits. Additionally, this plan includes coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care—all crucial aspects that contribute to maintaining good health over time.

Lastly, the combination of a $2000 deductible and a maximum out-of-pocket expense (MOOP) of $6000 provides an additional layer of cost control for the user, ensuring affordability in case of multiple medical needs within a calendar year while still offering substantial coverage.

Although the plan does exclude cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, it seems suitable for addressing the user's general healthcare requirements, given no specific health conditions are currently known. Ultimately, this Medibank Private PPO plan offers a balance of coverage, affordability, and cost control that caters to an upper-middle income earner with moderate health risk.
