Given your health profile with multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke-related symptoms, the EPO plan from HBF Health could be a suitable fit. This plan offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all essential components in managing your health issues.

The $500,000 coverage amount and the maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6,500 provide financial protection should you require extensive medical treatments or multiple hospital stays due to your complex health condition. The monthly premium of $300 remains affordable within your middle income bracket, ensuring manageable healthcare costs for you. Additionally, this plan's focus on preventive care can help you maintain your overall health and potentially mitigate further complications. Keep in mind that the plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, which might be an important consideration as well.
