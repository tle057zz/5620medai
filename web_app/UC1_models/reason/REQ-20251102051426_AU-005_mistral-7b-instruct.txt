Given the user's profile with no specific medical history, upper-middle income bracket, and a moderate risk level of 40%, the PPO plan from nib Health Funds appears to be a suitable choice.

Firstly, the comprehensive coverage of this plan, including hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, aligns well with the need for general medical care that most individuals require. The high coverage limit of $750,000 provides substantial financial protection in case of unexpected or extensive health issues.

Secondly, the monthly premium of $420 is affordable for an upper-middle income individual, ensuring manageable healthcare expenses. Moreover, the moderate risk level suggests that while the user may require occasional medical attention, they are unlikely to require extremely high coverage, making this plan a cost-effective choice.

Lastly, the maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense of $6000 ensures that in case the user encounters significant health issues, they will not face excessive financial burden due to medical expenses beyond the OOP limit. This feature offers peace of mind and protection against potential financial hardship.

In summary, the PPO plan from nib Health Funds provides a suitable balance of coverage, affordability, and risk level for this user profile, offering comprehensive healthcare services while remaining financially manageable.
