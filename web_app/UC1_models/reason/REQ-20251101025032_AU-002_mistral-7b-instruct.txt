Given the user's medical history of hypertension, a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plan from Medibank Private could be a suitable option due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care. This plan aligns well with the user's current health needs, as it provides extensive coverage for hospitalization and outpatient services that may be required for hypertension management.

Furthermore, the affordability of this plan is also suitable for the user, given their middle income bracket. The monthly premium of $420 is manageable, considering the extensive coverage provided by the plan. Moreover, the high coverage limit of $750,000 offers a significant financial safety net in case of unexpected health-related expenses.

The PPO structure of the plan also allows flexibility, as it allows the user to choose healthcare providers both inside and outside of the network, giving them more options for care. However, it's important to note that while this plan covers hospitalization and outpatient services, it does exclude cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, which should be considered when planning future medical needs. Overall, this plan offers a balance between coverage and affordability that fits well with the user's medical history, income, and employment status.
