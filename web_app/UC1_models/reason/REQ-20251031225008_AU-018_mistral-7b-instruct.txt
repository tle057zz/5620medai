This EPO plan from Queensland Country Health fits your comprehensive health needs due to its extensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all essential components given your multiple medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, etc.). The plan's $500,000 coverage provides ample financial protection for potential hospital stays or specialized treatments. Additionally, the affordable monthly premium of $300, aligned with your upper-middle income bracket, ensures budget friendliness without compromising on quality care. Despite higher risks associated with your medical history (risk=100), this plan's maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 and exclusions of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments help minimize potential financial burdens while focusing on necessary care.
