These aspects are essential considerations given the user's complex medical history. The high coverage limits for hospitalization ensure that extensive treatments or procedures required in case of emergencies or complications will be adequately covered.\n\nMoreover, the plan's affordability is an important factor, with a monthly premium of $420.
