The HMO plan from MyOwn Health Insurance offers comprehensive coverage for your health conditions, including hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, which aligns well with your medical profile. This plan also balances coverage and affordability, as it has a $500,000 coverage limit and a $340 monthly premium, making it an appropriate choice for individuals in the middle income bracket while keeping costs manageable given your higher risk level. However, keep in mind that this plan excludes cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments, and out-of-network services to help minimize additional expenses.
