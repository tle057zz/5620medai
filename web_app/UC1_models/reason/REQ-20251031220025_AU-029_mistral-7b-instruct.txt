This EPO plan from RT Health Fund could be a suitable fit for your profile due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and maternity care - all conditions relevant to your health situation. Additionally, its monthly premium of $320 and maximum out-of-pocket expense of $5000 offer affordability within the upper-middle income bracket, considering your higher risk level (100). However, it's important to note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are not included in this plan. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
