While the deductible is set at $3500, the coverage amount of $250,000 ensures substantial financial protection in case of extensive medical treatments related to hypertension management or potential complications.\n\nIn addition, the plan's maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) cost cap of $7500 provides an added layer of financial security for the user. This is particularly important considering that individuals with hypertension may require frequent visits to specialists and regular prescription medications, both of which can accumulate significant expenses over time.\n\nBy carefully balancing coverage and affordability, this HMO plan from ahm offers a suitable option for the user's current medical needs and financial situation, ensuring comprehensive health care support while minimizing potential out-of-pocket costs. It is essential to note that this plan excludes cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments, and out-of-network services – factors that may not significantly impact the user given their specific medical profile."
