With a high deductible of $1800 annually, it offers an affordable monthly premium of $320 while still providing substantial coverage of up to $750,000. This plan also has a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $5000, which helps cap your expenses in case of expensive treatments related to your conditions. It's important to note that the plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, which may not apply to your needs at this time."
