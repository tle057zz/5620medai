The EPO plan from Mildura Health Fund suits your medical profile primarily due to its extensive hospitalization coverage for conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes â€“ all of which you have been diagnosed with. With a coverage limit of $500,000, it ensures comprehensive support during inpatient treatments.

Moreover, the plan also includes outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, addressing your ongoing needs for managing conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Given your high income bracket and higher risk level, this moderately priced plan with a monthly premium of $300 offers a balance between affordability and coverage.

Additionally, the max out-of-pocket expense limit of $6500 provides financial protection against unexpected medical bills while excluding cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments that are not necessary for your medical condition. This plan can help ensure you receive necessary healthcare services effectively managing your health concerns.
