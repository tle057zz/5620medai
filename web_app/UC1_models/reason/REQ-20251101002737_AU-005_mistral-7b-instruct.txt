The PPO plan from nib Health Funds appears to be a suitable choice for this user given their specific medical profile and financial circumstances.

Firstly, the user's medical history indicates a high risk due to multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke. The comprehensive coverage of the PPO plan includes hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, which are essential for managing these ongoing health issues effectively. The high coverage limit of $750,000 provides extensive financial protection in case of unexpected medical events or prolonged treatments.

Secondly, the user's middle income bracket may make this plan affordable considering its monthly premium of $420. While it's important to note that premiums can vary based on location and other factors, this plan balances coverage needs with a manageable financial commitment for the user.

Thirdly, the PPO plan offers a reasonable deductible of $2000 and a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense of $6000 per year. This means that after meeting the annual deductible, the plan will cover a significant portion of eligible medical costs, further protecting the user from high medical bills.

In summary, the PPO plan from nib Health Funds offers comprehensive coverage for the user's complex medical history, is relatively affordable given their income bracket, and provides financial protection through its generous coverage limit, reasonable deductible, and OOP maximum. However, it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or an insurance broker to ensure this plan meets all specific needs and budget requirements.
