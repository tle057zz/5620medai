This EPO plan from National Health Benefits Australia (OneMedifund) is a suitable fit for your medical profile due to its comprehensive coverage that addresses your primary conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke. The $500,000 coverage caters well to the need for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all key aspects of managing your complex health concerns.

The monthly premium of $300 falls within your middle-income bracket, making it relatively affordable for you while ensuring adequate insurance coverage. Furthermore, the plan's Max Out-of-Pocket (MOOP) limit of $6500 sets a cap on additional expenses you might incur during the year, offering financial security as well.

While this plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, its focus on essential healthcare services aligns with your current medical needs, ensuring you receive appropriate coverage that directly addresses your health issues.
