Given the user's profile with no specific medical conditions mentioned, a middle-income bracket, and a moderate risk level of 40.0, the HMO plan from MyOwn Health Insurance appears to be a suitable fit for this individual.

Firstly, the plan's comprehensive coverage including hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, caters to general healthcare needs that are essential for an average individual. The high coverage amount of $500,000 provides significant financial protection in case of unexpected medical emergencies.

Secondly, the plan's affordability is another key aspect that aligns with the user's middle-income status. With a monthly premium of $340, this plan offers a balance between coverage and cost, making it more accessible for individuals with moderate incomes.

Lastly, the plan's limitations on cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments, and out-of-network services help manage costs by focusing on necessary medical expenses while excluding elective or high-cost optional services. This could be particularly beneficial for an individual without specific medical conditions, as it avoids unnecessary expenditure.

In summary, the HMO plan from MyOwn Health Insurance offers comprehensive coverage, affordability, and cost management features that align with the user's needs based on their profile, making it a potential fit for this individual. However, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or insurance advisor for personalized advice based on specific medical history and future health concerns.
