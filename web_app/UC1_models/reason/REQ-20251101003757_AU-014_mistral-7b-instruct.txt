Based on your comprehensive medical history which includes conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, shortness of breath, fatigue, right-sided weakness, the EPO plan from Phoenix Health Fund appears to be a suitable fit for your needs. This plan offers a coverage of $500,000 which is substantial and can provide significant financial assistance in case of hospitalization due to these chronic conditions.

The monthly premium of $300 is affordable given your upper-middle income bracket. It's important to note that while the deductible is set at $2500, this amount is manageable considering the potential high costs associated with treating multiple chronic conditions like the ones you have mentioned.

Moreover, the plan includes coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care which are essential given your ongoing medical needs. The Max Out-of-Pocket (MOOP) limit of $6500 ensures that once you reach this amount, the insurance will cover 100% of your eligible expenses for the rest of the year.

However, it's worth noting that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments. Given your current health conditions, these exclusions should not be a concern. In summary, the EPO plan from Phoenix Health Fund offers adequate coverage, is affordable given your income, and aligns well with your medical history and ongoing needs.
