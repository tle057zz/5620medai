Given your comprehensive medical history that includes conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, and shortness of breath, a robust hospitalization coverage is crucial for managing potential emergencies. The EPO plan from Mildura Health Fund offers a substantial coverage of $500,000, which can help cater to the high costs associated with treating these chronic conditions and potential complications.

The monthly premium of $300 aligns well with your upper-middle income bracket, ensuring affordability without undue financial strain. Moreover, this plan includes outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care coverage, which are essential for ongoing management of your medical conditions.

Lastly, the Max Out-of-Pocket (MOOP) limit of $6500 offers a cap on your yearly expenses for healthcare, providing additional financial security while focusing on recovery and maintaining optimal health. The exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments in this plan ensures cost-effectiveness by eliminating non-essential services from coverage considerations.
