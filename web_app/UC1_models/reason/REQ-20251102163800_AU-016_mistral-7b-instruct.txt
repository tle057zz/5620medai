Given the user's medical history of hypertension and their current income in the middle bracket, the HMO plan from MyOwn Health Insurance appears to be a suitable choice that balances coverage and affordability.

Firstly, the user's condition of hypertension is covered under this plan, with comprehensive hospitalization coverage ensuring access to necessary care should any serious complications arise. The high policy limit of $500,000 provides substantial financial protection in such cases. Moreover, outpatient services and prescription drugs are also included, which are essential for managing hypertension on a day-to-day basis. Preventive care is another significant benefit, as regular check-ups and screenings can help monitor and manage the user's condition effectively.

Secondly, considering the user's income falls within the middle bracket, the plan's monthly premium of $340 may be reasonably affordable. While it is higher compared to some other plans due to the extensive coverage offered, the potential savings from preventive care services and the financial protection in case of hospitalization could outweigh the increased premium costs over time.

Lastly, it's important to note that while this plan offers extensive coverage for hypertension-related needs, there are some exclusions such as cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments, and out-of-network services. As the user currently does not require these types of services, this plan should still meet their essential health care needs without incurring unnecessary costs. Overall, the HMO from MyOwn Health Insurance provides a comprehensive coverage for hypertension-related needs while remaining relatively affordable given the user's income level and risk profile.
