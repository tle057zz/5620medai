  "mistral:7b-instruct": "This EPO plan from National Health Benefits Australia (OneMedifund) suits your profile due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all vital aspects considering your multiple health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, etc.). Additionally, the plan's affordability with a monthly premium of $300, along with a manageable $6500 Max Out-of-Pocket limit, makes it an appropriate choice for your upper-middle income bracket. However, it's important to note that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, which aligns with your lower risk score of 100."
