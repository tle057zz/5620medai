The CBHS Health Fund's EPO plan with a monthly premium of $320 is well-suited for your health profile due to its comprehensive coverage that includes hospitalization for various conditions you're dealing with (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke), maternity care, outpatient services, and prescription drugs. The high coverage limit of $750,000 provides substantial financial protection in case of extensive medical needs related to your health issues.

Additionally, the plan's maximum out-of-pocket expense (Max OOP) limit of $5,000 ensures that you will not bear excessive healthcare costs once this amount is reached during a calendar year. This plan offers an optimal balance between coverage and affordability for individuals in high-income brackets with multiple health risks (risk=100). However, please note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are excluded from the coverage under this plan. It's essential to consult your healthcare professional for personalized advice before making a decision on insurance coverage.
