Given your low income bracket and a moderate health risk score (72.0), the HMO plan from MyOwn Health Insurance appears suitable for you. This plan offers comprehensive coverage for essential healthcare needs, including hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, all at an affordable monthly premium of $340. With a coverage limit of $500,000 and a deductible of $2500, this plan provides substantial financial protection in case of hospitalization, while keeping the out-of-pocket maximum to a manageable level of $6500. Since this plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, you can avoid unexpected costs for non-essential healthcare services, making it a financially prudent choice that caters to your specific health condition (hypertension) and financial situation.
