Given the user's medical history and current health status, which includes hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, shortness of breath, fatigue, right-sided weakness, the HMO plan from ahm (by Medibank) appears to be a suitable fit for their needs. This plan offers comprehensive coverage with a focus on hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and telemedicine services - all of which are crucial given the user's multiple chronic conditions.

In terms of affordability, the monthly premium of $260 might seem high initially but considering the extensive coverage provided and the user's upper-middle income bracket, it is reasonably priced. The plan also has a relatively low out-of-pocket maximum of $7500, which can help manage costs for the user in case of unexpected medical emergencies or hospitalizations related to their health conditions.

Additionally, the plan's exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments aligns with the user's focus on essential healthcare services rather than elective ones. While the deductible is $3500, this can be seen as a trade-off for more comprehensive coverage at an affordable monthly premium. Overall, the HMO plan from ahm (by Medibank) offers appropriate coverage to address the user's medical needs while also being financially viable given their income and employment status. However, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or insurance broker for personalized advice.
