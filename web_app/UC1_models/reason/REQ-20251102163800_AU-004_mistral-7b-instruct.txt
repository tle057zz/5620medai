The EPO plan from HCF presents a suitable fit for the user's profile due to its comprehensive coverage aligning well with the user's medical history and current health status. Given that hypertension is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management, this plan offers extensive hospitalization coverage which ensures adequate care in case of any complications or emergencies related to hypertension.

The monthly premium of $300 remains affordable for individuals within the middle income bracket, providing financial accessibility for the user. Additionally, the plan's maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) expense limit of $6500 helps protect the user from substantial unexpected medical costs.

Given the user's profile and health condition, it is crucial to have a plan with robust coverage for outpatient services and prescription drugs, as these are often frequent needs for individuals managing hypertension. The EPO plan caters to these requirements by offering coverage for both outpatient services and prescription drugs.

Lastly, the user's risk score of 72.0 indicates a relatively higher likelihood of needing healthcare services compared to average. This plan's extensive coverage and affordable premium make it an appropriate choice in addressing this increased need for medical care without putting undue financial strain on the user.
