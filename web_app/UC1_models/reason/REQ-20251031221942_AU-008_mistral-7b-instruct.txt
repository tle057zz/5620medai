The GMHBA Health Insurance's EPO plan is suitable for your high-income profile with multiple health conditions due to its comprehensive coverage that includes hospitalization for critical conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, which aligns closely with your diagnosed health issues.

Additionally, this plan offers outpatient services, prescription drug coverage, and preventive care, ensuring continuous support for managing your chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The affordable monthly premium of $300 keeps the cost manageable while maintaining substantial coverage of up to $500,000.

However, it's essential to be aware that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, so focus on necessary medical care related to your diagnosed conditions. The maximum out-of-pocket expense (MOOP) of $6500 offers some financial protection and helps keep costs under control in case of unexpected health complications.
