This EPO plan from National Health Benefits Australia (OneMedifund) suits the user's profile due to its comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, which aligns well with managing hypertension. The plan offers a high coverage limit of $500,000, providing ample financial support in case of extensive medical treatment required. Moreover, the affordable monthly premium of $300 fits within the user's low-income bracket and is balanced against the deductible of $2500 and Max Out-of-Pocket limit of $6500, ensuring reasonable financial protection for healthcare expenses. Lastly, excluding cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments from coverage helps to keep costs down while focusing on necessary medical care.
