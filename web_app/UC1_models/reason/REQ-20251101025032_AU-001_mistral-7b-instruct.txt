Given the user's medical history of hypertension and current data indicating no recent hospitalizations or severe complications, the PPO plan from Bupa Australia could effectively cater to the user's health needs. With a monthly premium of $420, this plan falls within the middle-income bracket, ensuring affordability for the user.

The coverage of $750000 provides substantial financial protection in case of hospitalization due to hypertension or any other health conditions that may arise. The deductible of $2000 is reasonably low, meaning the user will only have to cover this amount before the insurance starts covering costs, making it easier to manage healthcare expenses.

Furthermore, the plan includes coverage for outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care which are all essential aspects for a hypertension patient to maintain their health. The maximum out-of-pocket (Max OOP) limit of $6000 ensures that the user's total healthcare expenses will be capped, providing additional financial security.

However, it is important to note that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments. Given the user's current medical condition and financial situation, this plan appears to offer a suitable balance between coverage and affordability. It provides extensive coverage for essential healthcare services while keeping costs manageable. As always, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding insurance plans and health management strategies.
