Given your health profile with multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, the EPO from HIF plan with a monthly premium of $300 seems suitable. This plan provides extensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care which aligns with your health needs. Furthermore, the high coverage limit of $500,000 can help manage potential expensive treatments related to your conditions.

While the deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket expenses of $6500 might seem high, they are balanced by the comprehensive coverage offered. This plan offers a good balance between coverage and affordability for an individual in the middle income bracket with a higher risk profile like yours. It's worth noting that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, which can help manage unexpected costs in these areas.
