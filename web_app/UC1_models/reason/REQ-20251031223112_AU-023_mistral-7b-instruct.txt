The EPO plan from Teachers Health fits your profile due to its comprehensive coverage tailored to your health condition (hypertension). This plan offers hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drug benefits, and maternity care, all essential for managing hypertension effectively. Given your income bracket as low, the affordable monthly premium of $320 makes this plan accessible. Furthermore, with a high coverage of $750,000, you are well protected against potential high medical expenses related to your condition. The $1800 deductible and $5000 out-of-pocket maximum provide additional financial protection. However, please note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are not covered under this plan. It is important to consider these details when making your decision, keeping in mind the need for a balance between coverage and affordability.
