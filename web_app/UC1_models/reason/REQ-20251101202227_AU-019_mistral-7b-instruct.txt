Based on your medical history of hypertension and current health data, a comprehensive insurance plan like the EPO from Mildura Health Fund could be an ideal fit for you. This plan offers substantial hospitalization coverage up to $500,000, which is crucial given that ongoing management of hypertension may require frequent hospital visits or procedures.

Moreover, the plan provides coverage for outpatient services and prescription drugs, both of which are essential in managing your condition effectively. The preventive care benefits included in this plan can also help you maintain a healthy lifestyle by covering regular check-ups and screenings to monitor your hypertension.

Regarding affordability, your upper-middle income bracket aligns well with the $300 monthly premium for this plan. Although there is a deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket expense (Max OOP) of $6500 per year, these costs can be manageable given your financial situation. By choosing this plan, you'll have the peace of mind that comes with having ample insurance coverage to address potential health issues related to hypertension, while still keeping your premiums affordable.

It's important to note that the EPO plan from Mildura Health Fund excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments. Since these services are not relevant to managing your condition of hypertension, this exclusion does not affect the overall suitability of the plan for your needs. In summary, this insurance plan offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care, making it a suitable choice given your medical history, income, and risk level.
