The PPO plan from Bupa Australia fits your profile as it provides comprehensive coverage for your primary health concerns such as hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all crucial for managing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The high coverage of $750,000 ensures ample financial support in case of emergencies or extensive treatments. With a monthly premium of $420 and a deductible of $2000, this plan strikes a balance between affordability and adequate coverage within the middle-income bracket. Additionally, the maximum out-of-pocket expense ($6000) provides financial protection for unexpected medical costs, making it suitable for individuals with an increased health risk (100). However, it's important to note that this plan does not cover cosmetic procedures or experimental treatments, as specified in the exclusions.
