Given the user's medical history of hypertension and an upper-middle income bracket, along with a moderate risk level of 72.0, the EPO plan from Queensland Country Health appears to be a suitable choice for this individual.

Firstly, the high coverage of $500,000 provided under this plan is particularly beneficial for managing long-term conditions such as hypertension. This extensive coverage can help ensure that the user has access to necessary treatments and medications over an extended period, which may be essential given the ongoing nature of hypertension.

Secondly, the affordable monthly premium of $300 aligns well with the user's upper-middle income bracket, allowing them to comfortably afford the coverage without experiencing significant financial strain. Additionally, the lower deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 can help further minimize the user's overall healthcare costs, which is crucial for managing their hypertension expenses effectively.

Finally, the inclusion of outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care in the plan ensures that the user has comprehensive coverage for both hospitalization and non-hospitalization needs related to their hypertension management. The exclusion of cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments from the plan further helps maintain the affordability of the insurance while focusing on essential medical services.

Overall, the EPO plan from Queensland Country Health offers adequate coverage for managing the user's hypertension, is reasonably priced, and includes a range of important benefits that cater to their healthcare needs while minimizing out-of-pocket expenses. This makes it an ideal choice for the user's profile based on their medical history, income, and risk level.
