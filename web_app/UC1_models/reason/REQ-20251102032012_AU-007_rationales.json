The EPO plan from Australian Unity Health seems to be a suitable fit for the user's needs.\n\nFirstly, the plan offers hospitalization coverage with a high sum insured of $500,000. This substantial coverage amount is essential considering the user's medical history, as it provides financial protection in case of an emergency admission or complicated treatment related to their existing conditions.\n\nSecondly, the plan includes outpatient services and prescription drug coverage, which are important for managing chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Regular outpatient visits and medication management play a crucial role in maintaining these conditions and preventing complications.\n\nThirdly, the plan offers preventive care benefits, which can help the user maintain their overall health and potentially reduce the risk of further complications. Preventive care services may include annual check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations.\n\nRegarding affordability, the user's middle income bracket is taken into account with a monthly premium of $300. Although this plan does have a deductible of $2500 and a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500, these amounts may be manageable for the user given their income.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that the plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, which helps keep the premium costs down while focusing on essential medical care. This alignment between coverage needs and affordability makes the EPO plan from Australian Unity Health a suitable choice for this user profile."
