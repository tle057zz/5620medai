  "mistral:7b-instruct": "Given the user's medical history and current data, which includes fatigue, thirst, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, a comprehensive health insurance plan like EPO from HIF is well-suited to meet their needs. The user's profile indicates several chronic conditions that require ongoing management, hospitalization coverage in case of emergencies, outpatient services for regular check-ups, prescription drug coverage for medication management, and preventive care for early detection and treatment of potential complications.\n\nThe plan's monthly premium of $300 is affordable for an upper-middle income bracket individual, making it financially feasible for the user to maintain health insurance coverage. Furthermore, the policy offers a substantial coverage amount of $500,000 and a reasonable maximum out-of-pocket expense (Max OOP) of $6500, providing sufficient financial protection in case of expensive medical events or procedures related to their medical conditions.\n\nThe EPO plan also excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, ensuring the user does not bear unnecessary costs for non-essential services. In summary, this health insurance plan aligns with the user's medical requirements, offers affordable premiums, provides adequate coverage limits, and avoids covering elective or experimental treatments that may not be relevant to their current medical conditions."
