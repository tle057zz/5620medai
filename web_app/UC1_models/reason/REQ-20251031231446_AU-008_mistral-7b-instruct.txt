Given your medical history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, shortness of breath, fatigue, and right-sided weakness, the EPO plan from GMHBA Health Insurance could suit your needs effectively. This plan offers comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care which are crucial for managing your chronic conditions. The monthly premium of $300 is affordable for the middle income bracket, but it's important to consider that you have a higher risk profile (100), meaning more extensive medical needs. The high coverage limit of $500,000 and a moderate out-of-pocket maximum of $6,500 can help mitigate potential high medical expenses in the future. However, keep in mind that this plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, so it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider regarding appropriate coverage for any procedures related to your current health conditions.
