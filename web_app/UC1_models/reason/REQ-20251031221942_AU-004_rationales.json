  "mistral:7b-instruct": "The EPO plan from HCF with a monthly premium of $300 caters well to your health profile, as it offers comprehensive coverage for conditions you're dealing with, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and ischemic stroke. This plan provides hospitalization coverage, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care - all essential components for managing these complex medical conditions.\n\nThe high-deductible of $2500 and maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500 may seem substantial initially, but considering your income bracket (high) and risk level (100), it can help offset potential significant healthcare costs associated with managing multiple chronic conditions. Keep in mind that this plan excludes cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments, ensuring a more cost-effective approach to your primary health needs."
