Given your medical profile with multiple chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, requiring frequent hospitalization, outpatient services, and prescription drugs, the PPO plan from AIA Health Insurance is a suitable fit. With a coverage of $750,000, it offers ample financial protection for your extensive health needs. The monthly premium of $420 is affordable for the middle-income bracket, and the deductible of $2000 ensures you only pay this amount before the insurance kicks in, keeping out-of-pocket expenses manageable with a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $6000. This plan also provides preventive care coverage, promoting overall health maintenance. However, please note that cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are not covered under this plan.
