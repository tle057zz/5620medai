Given your medical history, which includes conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, ischemic stroke, and right-sided weakness, it's essential to have comprehensive coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and preventive care due to the potential frequency of health issues that may arise. The EPO plan from HCF offers $500,000 in coverage, which aligns with the need for extensive medical support for your current health concerns.

The monthly premium of $300 is affordable within the upper-middle income bracket, ensuring you can manage the costs while maintaining financial stability. Moreover, this plan has a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6500, which provides an additional layer of protection against unexpected medical bills.

While some treatments like cosmetic procedures and experimental treatments are not covered under this plan, focusing on essential care and affordability makes it well-suited to address your medical needs effectively.
