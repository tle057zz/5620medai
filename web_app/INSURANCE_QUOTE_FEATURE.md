## üìã Overview

The **Request Insurance Quote** feature is an AI-powered system that generates personalized insurance quotes for users based on their health data, medical history, and income details. The system uses sophisticated risk assessment algorithms to match users with the most suitable insurance products, ranked by suitability, cost, and coverage.

   - Detailed rationale (why each plan was recommended)
   - Coverage details and exclusions
   - Comparison tools

4. **Fallback Handling**:
   - No results ‚Üí Human advisor referral
   - Missing data ‚Üí Validation errors with retry

## üîç AI Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Risk Score Calculation (0-100 scale)

```
Base Risk: 20 points

Age Factors:
- Age > 60: +30 points
- Age 45-60: +20 points
- Age 30-45: +10 points

Condition Multipliers:
- Each condition multiplies by risk factor (1.5x to 3.5x)

BMI Factors:
- BMI > 30 (obese): 1.5x multiplier
- BMI > 25 (overweight): 1.2x multiplier
- BMI < 18.5 (underweight): 1.3x multiplier

Lifestyle:
- Smoking: 2.0x multiplier
- Family history: 1.3x multiplier
- 2+ hospitalizations: 1.4x multiplier

Final score capped at 100
```

### Eligibility Rules

```
Rule 1: High-risk patients (score > 70) excluded from budget plans
Rule 2: Low-income users limited to affordable plans (< $400/month)
Rule 3: Cancer patients require high coverage (‚â• $500K)
Rule 4: Chronic conditions benefit from management programs
```

### Scoring System

Each quote receives three scores (0-100):

**Suitability Score:**
- Plan type match (PPO/EPO for high-risk, HMO for low-risk): +15-20
- Condition-specific coverage match: +15-25
- Income bracket alignment: +10-15

**Cost Score (inverse):**
- Annual cost as % of income:
  - < 5%: 100 points
  - 5-10%: 80 points
  - 10-15%: 60 points
  - 15-20%: 40 points
  - > 20%: 20 points

**Coverage Score:**
- Coverage amount: 5-30 points
- Number of coverage details: up to 30 points
- Exclusions penalty: -3 points each
- Low deductible: +15 points
- Low out-of-pocket max: +20 points

**Overall Score:** Average of all three scores
