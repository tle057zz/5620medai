# 🔒 Role-Based Access Control Update - Insurance Quote Feature

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Insurance quote request feature should be PATIENT-ONLY  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🎯 Problem

The insurance quote request feature was accessible to both patients AND doctors, but it should be **patient-only**. Doctors should only be able to **review** insurance quotes that patients share with them, not request quotes themselves.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Updated Route Permissions (app.py)**

Added `@role_required('patient')` decorator to patient-only routes:

| Route | Before | After | Reason |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| `/insurance/request-quote` | `@login_required` only | `@login_required` + `@role_required('patient')` | Patients request quotes for themselves |
| `/insurance/prefill-from-document` | `@login_required` only | `@login_required` + `@role_required('patient')` | Part of patient quote workflow |
| `/insurance/history` | `@login_required` only | `@login_required` + `@role_required('patient')` | Patients view their own history |
| `/insurance/favorite/<id>/<pid>` | `@login_required` only | `@login_required` + `@role_required('patient')` | Patients save their favorites |
| `/insurance/share-with-doctor/<id>` | `@login_required` only | `@login_required` + `@role_required('patient')` | Patients share with doctors |

### **2. Updated Doctor Dashboard (dashboard_doctor.html)**

**Before:**
```html
<h5>Insurance Quotes (NEW)</h5>
<ul>
  <li>AI-powered quote generation</li>
  <li>Review pending requests</li>
  ...
</ul>
<a href="pending_reviews">Pending Reviews</a>
<a href="request_quote">Request Quote</a>  ← REMOVED
```

**After:**
```html
<h5>Insurance Quote Reviews</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Review AI-generated quotes</li>
  <li>Validate medical appropriateness</li>
  <li>Provide professional recommendations</li>
  <li>Override AI rankings if needed</li>
</ul>
<a href="pending_reviews">View Pending Reviews</a>
<p>Patients share their quotes with you for medical validation.</p>
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Removed "Request Quote" button for doctors
- ✅ Changed title from "Insurance Quotes (NEW)" to "Insurance Quote Reviews"
- ✅ Updated description to emphasize doctor's **review role**
- ✅ Changed card styling to warning (yellow) to indicate review action
- ✅ Added clarifying text about patients sharing quotes
