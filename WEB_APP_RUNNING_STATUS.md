## ⚠️ Partially Working

### AI Medical Document Processing
- ⚠️ **Currently DISABLED** due to missing dependencies
- The web app will show a warning: "AI Medical modules not available"
- Users can still **manually enter** health data
- File upload field is visible but document processing won't work

**Reason:** Python 3.13 is incompatible with older SpaCy/SciSpacy versions

---

## ❌ What's Not Working

### AI Medical Pipeline Features
The following features require SpaCy models (not installed):
- ❌ OCR text extraction from uploaded PDFs
- ❌ Medical document sectionization
- ❌ Named Entity Recognition (NER) for medical terms
- ❌ Entity linking to medical ontologies (SNOMED-CT, RxNorm)
- ❌ Auto-fill form from uploaded documents
- ❌ Enhanced safety assessment using medical entities

---

## 🔧 How to Enable AI Medical Features

### Option 1: Use Python 3.11 (Recommended)

1. **Check if Python 3.11 is available:**
   ```bash
   python3.11 --version
   ```

2. **If not installed, install via Homebrew:**
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.11
   ```

3. **Create new virtual environment with Python 3.11:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/thanhle/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-lenhothanh.nsl@gmail.com/.shortcut-targets-by-id/1Je2GU6cAmriwQ_9lhORCt8JeHBjH-2Yq/ELEC5620/Code/5620medai
   
   python3.11 -m venv venv_ai
   source venv_ai/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install Flask
   pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org flask flask-login flask-wtf
   
   # Install AI medical dependencies
   pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org scispacy spacy pytesseract pdf2image Pillow PyMuPDF sentence-transformers
   
   # Install SpaCy models
   pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.1.tar.gz
   
   pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.5.1.tar.gz
   ```

5. **Restart the web app:**
   ```bash
   cd web_app
   python3.11 app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Continue Without AI Features

- The web app works perfectly fine without AI document processing
- Users can manually enter all health data
- All insurance quote features work normally
- This is sufficient for testing the workflow and UI

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the current web app** - Everything except document upload works
2. **Decide if you need AI features:**
   - **YES** → Follow "Option 1" above to install Python 3.11
   - **NO** → Continue using current setup with manual data entry
3. **Provide feedback** on the insurance quote workflow
4. **Test all user roles** (doctor, patient, admin)

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility:**
   - SpaCy and SciSpacy don't support Python 3.13 yet
   - This is a known upstream issue
   - Workaround: Use Python 3.11 or 3.10

2. **Document Upload:**
   - Shows in UI but won't process files
   - No error - just silently fails to extract data
   - Users can still enter data manually

3. **macOS SSL Certificates:**
   - Worked around using `--trusted-host` flags
   - Should not affect normal usage

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the terminal output for error messages
2. Ensure the Flask server is running
3. Verify you're logged in with the correct user role
4. Remember: Insurance quotes are **patient-only** feature
