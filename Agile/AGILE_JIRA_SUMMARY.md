## 🎓 Agile Concepts - Quick Summary

### Core Principles

**Iterative Development**:
- Build in small increments
- Your project: UC-01 → UC-02 → UC-03 → UC-04 → UC-05
- Each sprint delivers working software

**Collaboration**:
- Daily standups (15 min)
- Team owns the project together
- Help each other succeed

**Responding to Change**:
- Requirements can change
- Adjust sprint plan if needed
- Flexible, not fixed

**Working Software**:
- Demo working features every sprint
- Code that runs > documentation
- Show, don't tell

---

### Agile Roles

**Product Owner** (recommend: 1 team member):
- Prioritizes backlog
- Defines acceptance criteria
- Makes feature decisions

- Removes blockers
- Protects team from distractions
- Tracks metrics

**Development Team** (all 5 members):
- Estimates work
- Commits to sprint
- Delivers working software
- Self-organizing

**Stakeholders**:
- Professor/TA
- End users (patients, doctors)
- Provide feedback

---

### Agile Ceremonies

**Sprint Planning** (2-4 hours, every 2 weeks):
- Review backlog
- Estimate stories
- Commit to sprint
- Break down tasks

**Daily Standup** (15 min, every day):
- What I did yesterday
- What I'll do today
- Any blockers

**Sprint Review** (1-2 hours, end of sprint):
- Demo working features
- Gather feedback
- Update backlog

**Sprint Retrospective** (1-2 hours, end of sprint):
- What went well
- What to improve
- Action items
